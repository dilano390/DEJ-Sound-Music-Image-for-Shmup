# DEJ-Sound-Music-Image-for-Shmup
Sound, Music &amp; Image for Shmup Assigment for INTRO TO VISUAL MEDIA PROGRAMMING


I downloaded the entire code from [kidscancode](https://kidscancode.org/blog/2016/09/pygame_shmup_part_10/)https://kidscancode.org/blog/2016/09/pygame_shmup_part_10/.
From here on when trying to run I run into errors. Because I did not download the assets. I did this on purpose so that I get notified of everything I need to replace.

I then went through the process of looking for assets I thought were fitting for each of the missing assets. For this I used the following 2 sites: https://mixkit.co and https://opengameart.org/
Some of the assets I found were in spritesheets, I used to following website to cut them into seperate images: https://ezgif.com/
These assets all happened to have animations included. So after setting up the basic images I implemented the animation for every part of the game: The bullets, The explosions(this was already set up) and The mobs
